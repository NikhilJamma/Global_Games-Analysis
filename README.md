# Global Game Sales Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Global Game Sales Data Analysis project! This project aims to provide valuable insights into the world of video game sales using a comprehensive dataset sourced from vgchartz.com. In this README file, we'll provide an overview of the project, the dataset used, the research questions answered, and instructions on how to navigate through the project's folders and resources.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It provides a rich set of fields, including:

- **Rank**: The ranking of overall sales.
- **Name**: The name of the video game.
- **Platform**: The platform on which the game was released (e.g., PC, PS4, etc.).
- **Year**: The year of the game's release.
- **Genre**: The genre of the game.
- **Publisher**: The publisher of the game.
- **NA_Sales**: Sales in North America (in millions).
- **EU_Sales**: Sales in Europe (in millions).
- **JP_Sales**: Sales in Japan (in millions).
- **Other_Sales**: Sales in the rest of the world (in millions).
- **Global_Sales**: Total worldwide sales.

This dataset offers a wealth of insights into the dynamics between platforms, genres, regions, and global sales trends for the top 100 video games worldwide.

## Research Questions

In this project, we performed data analysis and data mining to answer three research questions related to the gaming industry:

1. **Question 1**: How does a ML model's predictions based on ratings compare to actual global sales of games?

2. **Question 2**: What is the projected trend for video game sales by top publisher in each genre for the year 2017 based on historical data from 1980 to 2016?

3. **Question 3**: What is the impact of changing release year of a game on global sales, as predicted by a ML model?

## Project Structure

This GitHub repository is organized into two main folders:

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis (`global_video_game_sales.csv`) and the presentation (`GGS-Presentation.pdf`) summarizing the findings related to the research questions.

- **Code**: Contains the code and Jupyter Notebook files (`GGS-DataAnalysis.ipynb` and `GGS-DataMining.ipynb`) used for data analysis and data mining. These notebooks provide step-by-step explanations of how the research questions were addressed.

## Getting Started
